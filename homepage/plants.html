        To a large majority of the world, New Yorkers are viewed as people who are generally rude, aggressive, and hard to impress. While all of that is true a good amount of the time, there are places that New Yorkers are much more friendly and communal. One of these places is a mall near the end of the M line, at the Metropolitan Avenue station. Contrary to the stereotypes New Yorkers usually have, this modified building has shown who New Yorkers really are. Instead of being pushy and loud, the New Yorkers there would stop and help somebody if they needed it. A random person would help get a bundle of toilet paper off the top shelf in the BJs at the end of the main floor. Another would let someone go in front of them in line if they had a single item compared to their full cart. Somebody else would give directions to help navigate this vast and unfamiliar area. While all of these seem to be moderate and insignificant, it shows that on the inside, New Yorkers want to care and they just need the right place to bring it out of them. That is what the mall was to me: a symbol of kindness in New York.

          This hospitality also applies to the city itself that New Yorkers reside in. New Yorkers cherish the places they go to in this city, and it leaves an effect on New Yorkers when those places are gone because of the constant changing the city does. The second floor of the mall is one of these lost locations. The effect that just the two stores there had on me as a child is incredibly significant. All of the drives and walks to the mall, never-ending excitement as my family and I got closer and closer. Finally, when those sliding doors opened, and I saw the big sign that read out “Toys R Us”, the excitement erupted into uncontrollable energy. I would be the first one at the door, having everyone race behind me in the smell of newly mopped floors as I followed my sporadic  but methodical route through the huge store. Eventually, I would settle on something I wanted, and then it was my sister's turn to experience the same thing. The excitement, where every step forward would make you feel like you were going on a new adventure. Those memories are staples of what my childhood was like. For a while, I treated these memories as something of the present. Unfortunately, I can’t anymore. When thinking of the second floor, I think of what was replaced and how I don’t have that sense of caring about what is there now. There are no feelings of attachment to the lifeless Amazon warehouse there now, and I can only think about what used to be and the memories I made there. There are most likely other people who feel the same way about that second floor, that a place where they spent their childhood is now gone. The Amazon warehouse there has the same effect on other New Yorkers that it does on me: one of nostalgia. That will be the legacy of the second floor of the mall, in my deepest memories of joy, but also reminiscence now that it is gone.

          This is what my New York is like. My New York is defined by old childhood attractions being replaced by more unvaried and dull places. What I mean when I say my New York is a constant state of change, especially to the places I care about the most and in ways where those places don’t mean anything to me anymore. Nothing exemplifies this more than the replacement of the second floor in the mall. The second floor my child-self would have described is a magical place where you could turn a corner and find something completely new and fantastical, much like the kid in a toy store that I was. Now that I’ve grown up, I see New York as more of the same, uninteresting city because I’d become so used to it. That is what the second floor is now for most people. They are there to do a job and go home. This is the way I treat being in the city now. I don’t go around anymore and try to “explore” the city. Now I take the same route every day, where commuting has no enjoyment and it just serves as a means to an end. Whereas before, I would view the second floor of the mall with that childish excitement, now I don’t go there anymore, and the people who do treat it the same way I treat the city, a way to get by, covered in boredom and monotony.
